# DevsHub

Committed to connecting engineers to opportunities.

# Why?

Software Engineers have a difficult time finding projects/teams to work on. This makes it difficult for them to gain real experiences and apply their skills to actual projects. DevsHub solves this problem and brings real opportunities to engineers by connecting engineers with one another and encouraging them to work together on exciting projects.
